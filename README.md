# KneeXpert: YOLO-based Detection of Knee Osteoarthritis

This project focuses on detecting knee osteoarthritis using YOLOv5 for object detection and TensorFlow/Keras for further processing and classification. The system is designed to automate the detection of osteoarthritis by analyzing knee X-ray images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- YOLOv5
- TensorFlow 2.x
- PyTorch
- PIL
- Matplotlib
